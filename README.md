# Homies of Catan

Recreating the classic Settlers of Catan board game

## [Rules of the game](https://www.catan.com/service/game-rules)

Future Dev:
- Use react-hexagon npm package to generate each game tile, including one giant one for them all to go inside.
- Each hex accepts a children prop, but the challenge is building the roads and settlements/cities. Maybe create some SVG backgrounds to load that collectively create the roads/settlements/cities when fit together. What would be sweet is if you can pass in the color value for that player and then technically not have to reload/swap out the SVG's because they already have those empty spaces ready to be filled..except city vs settlement?
- Investigate editing SVG's...might not be possible like that.
